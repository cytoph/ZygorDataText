# Zygor DataText (ZDT)

This is a simple, light-weight addon that does nothing more or less than adding a data broker for the Zygor Guide Viewer.

It only displays the name of the addon and let's you show or hide its main window by pressing the broker.

Should work with any addon that uses data brokers - only ElvUI was tested (for FuBar maybe Broker2FuBar is necessary).

 

I DO NOT OWN ZYGOR GUIDES VIEWER, NOR AM I AFFILIATED WITH THEM IN ANY WAY.
